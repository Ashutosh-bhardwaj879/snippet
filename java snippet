{
	// Place your snippets for java here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
		// Example:
		"starter": {
			"prefix": "starter",
			"body": [
                "public class tutorial ",
				"{",
				"public static void main(String args[])",
				"{",
				"//\tSystem.out.println();",
				"\t$1",
			   "}",
			   "}",
				
			],
			"description": "This is starter"
		}
